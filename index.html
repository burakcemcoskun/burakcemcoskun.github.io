  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
Born in Istanbul in 1994, Burak Cem Coşkun graduated with distinction from the Physics Engineering Department of Istanbul Technical University in 2017. He conducted research on neutron stars and nuclear physics at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden. While pursuing his master’s studies in theoretical astrophysics at the University of Bonn (Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn) in Germany, he continued his graduate education at Sabancı University. His work has focused on the interaction between ultra-dense neutron superfluids and exotic nuclei. Coşkun writes popular science and history of science articles for the magazine Herkese Bilim ve Teknoloji. He translated Feynman, a graphic biography published in Turkish by Alfa Publishing. He is the author of the science fiction works Kusur (The Defect), Işık Getiren (Light Bringer), Bilim ve Şiir (Science & Poetry), Uglata, and Hayal Krizi & Gün’düşü Hikâyeleri (Dream Attack & Daydream Fictions), all published by KDY. He is also the author of Magnetic Monopole Dreams in Blue Anatolian Nights, a Volume II selection of Science & Poetry. His science fiction stories have appeared in various anthologies and printed collections. His piece “Trojan 137” was included in the Anthology of Turkish Science Fiction Stories, the first English-language Turkish science fiction anthology published by TPLondon. In 2025, he published his bilingual philosophical manifesto Doğa Üzerine ve Yönteme Karşı – On Nature & Against Method, which deals with the philosophy of science. In his works, he frequently blends physics with poetry, weaving scientific imagination into literary expression. He is also the creator of the sci-fi & fantasy universe called “Tales of The Monsters of Blue Anatolia - IYON 7”. His poems are also regularly published in the magazine Yerli Bilimkurgu Yükseliyor.  </p>

  Improving the skills for understanding the physics behind the compact objects in the universe, widening the knowledge of astro-material science, and investigating the relations between high energy astrophysics and particle physics. Gaining a deep understanding of the nucleon-nucleon interactions (at denser and normal regimes), superfluidity, and superconductivity through advanced quantum mechanics
and eventually finding a way to describe the interactions between the super-dense
neutron superfluid and a highly complex inside-out nuclei
